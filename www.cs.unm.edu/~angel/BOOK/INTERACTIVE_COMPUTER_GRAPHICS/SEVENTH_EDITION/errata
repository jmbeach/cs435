The rotating square examples for Chapter 3 were all updated to correct two errors that cancelled each other out. The first error was the order of vertices. As in the original code, the first triangle in the triangle strip was defined in clockwise manner which in WebGL defines a back face, which leads to all the triangles in the strip being back facing. This would cause a problem if culled is turned on. Second, the rotation had the x and y reversed making it a concatenation of a reflection and a rotation, which cancelled out the first error. All three examples have been fixed. Thanks to Ken Lodge ( Charles Sturt University, Australia) for pointing out these errors.

The correct code is

    var vertices = [
        vec2(  0,  1 ),
        vec2(  -1,  0 ),
        vec2( 1,  0 ),
        vec2(  0, -1 )
    ];

and

    gl_Position.x = -s * vPosition.y + c * vPosition.x;
    gl_Position.y =  s * vPosition.x + c * vPosition.y;
